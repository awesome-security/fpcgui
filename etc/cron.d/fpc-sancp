# Recommendation for crontab, add at least restart every night at 00
# 00 00 * * * root /etc/init.d/fpc-sancp restart

# run cleandisk (at least) every hour to make sure you are not 
# running out of disk space on loaded systems/small disk etc.
# 00 * * * * root /etc/init.d/fpc-sancp cleandisk
# Note: If you are running out of disk space during a day,
#       you need to restart more often, to break up the pcap
#       files, so that cleandisk dont delete the "live" file!
