# Full Packet Capture GUI
#########################

FPCGUI is a frontend to handle packet captures.
Its aim is for Network Security Monitoring who wants to
have a non-commersial cheap storrage for doing Network Forensics.

It is built on daemonlogger (A great packet capture daemon by Martin Roesch)
and sancp (Security Analyst Network Connection Profiler).

daemonlogger is responsable for dumping pcaps to disk.
sancp indexes connections, making them searchable.
(sancp stores data in mysql or alike)
	(apache + php is used for gui)


Carving:
/usr/sbin/tcpdump -r /nsm_data/hostname/dailylogs/2009-09-09/snort.log.1251338461 -w /tmp/80.30.200.100:56640_74.50.87.122:80-6.raw host 74.50.87.122 and host 80.30.200.100 and port 80 and port 56640 and proto 6


Some notes for the future:
*  Extraction of files
*  Indexing of files (like sancp, but for types of files flying over the network)
   studdy the network and add meta data about files (from streams it sees them in) to DB
*  Load list of "bad IPs" and see if there has been any traffic with them...
